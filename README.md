# UNIQ-deepmind

Welcome to the DeepMind UNIQ internship training course. This repository was made to introduce basic concepts within the powerful `scikit-learn` framework. It is divided into two modules in the form of colab notebooks:
1. [Introducing Scikit Learn](./colab/Introducing-Scikit-Learn-UNIQ.ipynb) from the [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/)
    * Data Representation
    * Scikit-Learn's Estimator API
    * Supervised toy example
    * Unsupervised toy example
    * Hand-written digits toy example

2. A [colab notebook](./colab/UNIQ_scikit_learn_pt_2.ipynb) outlining a use case of `scikit-learn` in a real-world data science problem from my past research.
    * Data input processing
    * Dataset creation
    * Data feature extraction and pre-processing
    * Model instantiation and prediction
    * Model performance metrics with 

Extensions are available [TBA].
